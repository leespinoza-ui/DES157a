        <h2>Set 1 — Bows & Soft Romance</h2>
        <p>This set feels soft and romantic because of the nude base and thin white
          bow linework. The small red hearts add contrast without overpowering
          the design.</p>

        <p>It’s feminine and polished, perfect for Valentine’s Day or a date night.
          I would refine the linework to make the bows even cleaner and more precise.</p>

      <!-- SECTION 2 -->
      <section class="story-section" id="set2">
        <h2>Set 2 — Bold Red Tips</h2>
        <p> This set stands out because of the bold red tips that frame the nail.
          The nude base keeps it balanced while the glossy finish makes it pop.</p>

        <p>It feels confident and dramatic. I would focus on making each red tip
          more consistent for a sharper overall look.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- SECTION 3 -->
      <section class="story-section" id="set3">
        <h2>Set 3 — Valentine Mix & Match</h2>
        <p>This set is playful because each nail has a slightly different design.
          The red and pink palette keeps everything cohesive.</p>

        <p>It combines bold shapes with small details, making it fun and eye-catching.
          This is the set I’d wear when I want my nails to be the main focus.</p>
