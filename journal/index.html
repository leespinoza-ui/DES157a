      <p> The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills” emphasizes the importance of slowing down and actively engaging with images rather than consuming them at a glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        What stood out to me most was the idea that visual thinking is a learned skill that improves through questioning and discussing. By encouraging viewers to look closely, notice detail, and infer meaning, the article reframes images as sources of inquiry rather than decoration. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To explore how visual thinking is applied in digital spaces, it is known for people to utilize  “Awwwards” to help them through this process. This is because  “Awwwards” remains a valuable resource for visual inspiration and reinforces how interaction design can deepen visual thinking when used significantly.

        <h2>Learning Journal 2: Overuse of Overlays and Dialog Windows</h2>

      <p>
        The article Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes by the Nielsen Norman Group examines how overlays, such as modals and dialog windows,can negatively affect user experience when they are overused or poorly implemented. Although overlays are often intended to highlight important information, the article explains that they frequently interrupt user flow and obscure content.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main points emphasized is that overlays should be used sparingly and only when they clearly support a user’s goal. Many overlays could be replaced with inline content or dedicated pages, which help users remain oriented within the interface. Overlays that appear unexpectedly or demand immediate action often increase cognitive load and lead users to dismiss them without engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        I found the discussion of accessibility particularly important. Improperly designed overlays can create significant barriers for keyboard and screen reader users.This article reinforced the idea that effective interface design should prioritize clarity, accessibility, and user control over visual emphasis.

        <h2>Learning Journal 1: Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">

      <p>
        The article <em>Best Practices for Form Design emphasizes how thoughtful web form design can drastically improve user experience in digital interactions. Forms are one of the primary ways users communicate with online systems, and poor design can make common tasks feel frustrating and inefficient.
      </p>

      <p>
        One idea the author highlights is that form design should minimize user effort by reducing unnecessary complexity and guiding users through completion with clarity. The goal is not only to collect information, but to do so without creating confusion or unnecessary cognitive load.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I found most interesting was the importance of inline feedback and minimizing errors before submission, because even small design decisions can determine whether a user completes a form or abandons it. Understanding these principles will help me create interfaces that are more user-friendly and effective.
